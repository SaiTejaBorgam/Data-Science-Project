## This repository consists all my files for Msc. Data Science Project Module
Research Question: Which machine learning algorithms among SVM, Decision Trees, XGBoost and LSTM can perform better in predicting the prices of Bitcoin and Ethereum when trained with financial technical indicators?

### When I changed code file name to indicate it as final code it didn't read the contents of the code file and so uploaded final code file again. Refer commits section to see previous versions and updates of code under file 'Project code.ipynb' and you can also browse that file from commits to see the repository at every particular commit.

4 Models were trained on Both Bitcoin and Ethereum dataset are saved and uploaded to github, All files generated during process of project are also posted here.
